👤 About Me
Welcome to my GitHub! I am Saba Zarean Shahraki, a Medical Informatics researcher specializing in the application of machine learning and deep learning to clinical and oncology data. My work bridges healthcare and artificial intelligence, with hands-on experience developing time-to-event deep learning models, conducting survival analysis, and building predictive algorithms for cancer outcomes. I am particularly interested in applying advanced ML techniques to challenges in medical data analytics, risk prediction, and real-world clinical datasets. With a strong foundation in both software engineering and health data science, I enjoy transforming complex clinical problems into practical, data-driven solutions. My projects reflect a commitment to improving decision-making in healthcare, advancing AI-assisted diagnosis, and supporting research in areas such as breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and chronic disease management.
